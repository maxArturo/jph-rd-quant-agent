# orchestrator/ — module notes

- Config pattern: all env/config loading goes through `orchestrator/config.py`
  (process environment overrides the repo-root `.env`; raise `ConfigError`
  naming the missing variable and where to set it). Extend that module for new
  settings instead of reading `os.environ` elsewhere.
- Slack tokens come from the repo-root `.env` (SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN xoxb-,
  SLACK_SOCKET_TOKEN xapp-, SLACK_CHANNEL_ID). Never route Slack through the
  OneCLI proxy and never vault these (docs/decisions.md 2026-07-08).
- Persistent state goes through `orchestrator/state.py` (`StateStore`), not ad
  hoc sqlite3 calls. It opens a short-lived connection per method, so one
  instance is safe to share between Bolt handlers and background pollers —
  never cache a `sqlite3.Connection` across threads. Extend the schema by
  adding `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` statements to `_SCHEMA` (migration reruns
  on every startup). Dedup/uniqueness lives in the schema (runs.thread_ts PK
  → `DuplicateRunError`; pending_interactions.interaction_key UNIQUE → insert
  returns `None`), so restarts can't double-post.

- All orchestrator LLM calls go through `orchestrator/llm.py` (`ModelRouter`):
  `judgment()` = claude-fable-5 (streamed, server-side refusal fallback to
  opus-4-8), `utility()` = claude-haiku-4-5, `judgment_tool_loop()` for tool
  use. Model IDs must not appear anywhere else — tests/test_llm.py greps for
  them. Never pass a `thinking` parameter (fable-5 400s on any explicit
  config). Refusals surface as `RefusalError`; check `stop_reason` before
  reading `content` on any hand-rolled call. `ModelRouter(client=...)` accepts
  a fake client for tests (see FakeClient in tests/test_llm.py — stub
  `client.beta.messages.stream` as a context manager with
  `get_final_message()`, and `client.messages.create`).

- Conversational behavior lives in `orchestrator/conversation.py`
  (`ConversationCore`) with prompt text in `orchestrator/prompts.py` — add new
  Slack-facing tools (start_research, set_universe, ...) as `ToolSpec`s built
  inside ConversationCore (handlers close over `thread_ts` + `say`), not as
  new Bolt listeners. `app.py` depends only on the `MessageResponder`
  protocol, so tests stub the core with a plain class (see FakeConversation in
  tests/test_slack_app.py) and core tests reuse FakeClient from
  tests/test_llm.py — no MagicMock of Anthropic needed. Durable per-thread
  context must reload from SQLite into the system prompt (in-memory history
  is lost on restart by design).

- All talk to rdagent server_ui goes through `orchestrator/rdagent_client.py`
  (`RdAgentClient`, default `http://127.0.0.1:19899`). It speaks the REAL
  upstream protocol, which differs from the PRD sketch — see the endpoint
  mapping table in docs/decisions.md (US-019 entry). Key semantics: runs
  start via POST /upload; `pending()` piggybacks on the POST /trace message
  poll (each poll drains ≤1 pending interaction server-side, and answered
  requests stay in the stream — dedup with `PendingInteraction.key`, and skip
  kinds `init_params`/`base_features`, which `start_run()` auto-answers);
  `submit()` answers the OLDEST unanswered interaction (FIFO queue, not
  addressed to a specific request); `resume()` raises
  `UnsupportedActionError` until US-024 extends research/server_ui.py.
  `locate_artifacts(trace_dir)` unpickles `runner result` pkls — trace dirs
  for server-started runs live under `~/rdq-runs/server_ui/traces/<trace_id>`,
  NOT under the LOG_TRACE_PATH convention of the CLI wrappers. Tests: stub
  the server with a real threaded Flask app (StubServerUi in
  tests/test_rdagent_client.py — reuse it for poller/tool tests) and pass
  `base_features={...}` so the client never imports rdagent.
- Session-path convention (US-020): `runs.session_path` stores
  `str(client.trace_dir(handle.trace_id))`; recover the trace id for API
  calls with `client.trace_id_of(session_path)`. Tools that only need
  start_run/trace_dir/stop should depend on the `ResearchLauncher` protocol
  in conversation.py (stub-friendly — see StubLauncher in
  tests/test_conversation.py) rather than the concrete client.

## Testing Bolt apps (see tests/test_slack_app.py)

- Bolt >=1.15 constructs a NEW real `WebClient` per request in
  `App._init_context` — injecting a mocked client into `App(client=...)` is
  NOT enough; `say()`/`context.client` would hit the network. Also
  monkeypatch `slack_bolt.app.app.WebClient` to return the mock, but only
  AFTER `App()` is constructed (its constructor isinstance-checks that same
  symbol).
- `MagicMock(spec=WebClient)` misses instance attributes `_init_context`
  reads (`base_url`, `timeout`, `ssl`, `proxy`, `headers`, `logger`,
  `retry_handlers`) — set them explicitly on the mock.
- Pass `process_before_response=True` in tests so listeners run synchronously
  inside `App.dispatch()`; otherwise assertions race Bolt's worker threads.
  Do NOT enable it in production once handlers are slow (Claude calls):
  Slack retries events not acked within ~3s.
- Dispatch events as
  `BoltRequest(body=json.dumps({"type": "event_callback", "event": {...}, ...}), mode="socket_mode")`.
- Handlers must ignore `subtype` messages (message_changed, channel_join, ...)
  and anything with `bot_id`, or the bot replies to its own replies (loop).
  In-thread reply target: `event.get("thread_ts") or event["ts"]`.

- Hypothesis steering lives in `orchestrator/poller.py` (`HypothesisPoller`):
  one instance per process polls all `running` runs and also owns the button
  handlers (`approve`/`reject`/`request_edit`/`consume_edit_reply`). app.py
  depends on it only via the `InteractionHandler` protocol and registers the
  Block Kit `hypo_approve`/`hypo_edit`/`hypo_reject` action listeners plus the
  edit-reply interception (checked BEFORE the conversational core sees a
  thread message). Lifecycle lives in `pending_interactions.status`:
  `pending → editing → approved|edited|rejected` (feedback: `auto_approved`);
  dedup is the schema UNIQUE key, so restarts never repost. Answer FIFO rule:
  never submit anything for a run while an earlier hypothesis row is still
  `pending`/`editing` — responses answer the oldest blocked request. If a
  Slack post or submit fails, free/keep the row so the next poll or click
  retries (never resolve a row whose submit didn't go through).
- Reject has no upstream regenerate action — `rejection_payload()` rides the
  instruction in the hypothesis text (see docs/decisions.md US-021 entry)
  and MUST keep the exact constructor key set (`type(hypo)(**dict)`).
- Testing Bolt block actions: dispatch a `{"type": "block_actions", ...}`
  payload as `BoltRequest(body=json.dumps(payload), mode="socket_mode")`
  (no event_callback envelope — interactive payloads ARE the body); Bolt
  injects `ack`/`action`/`say`, and `process_before_response=True` keeps it
  synchronous. See dispatch_action in tests/test_poller.py.

- Run-completion output lives in `orchestrator/summary.py`: `load_metrics`
  (qlib_res.csv is a pandas Series csv — metric name index, one value
  column), `format_summary` (the metric-label -> qlib-key mapping lives in
  METRIC_SPECS; qlib logs NO Sharpe — it is derived from ret.pkl net daily
  returns, see docs/decisions.md US-022), `render_equity_curve` (matplotlib
  with the Agg backend selected BEFORE importing pyplot, lazy imports so
  offline tests stay fast; returns PNG bytes for `files_upload_v2`).
  ret.pkl is qlib's report_normal_1day DataFrame (columns account/return/
  turnover/cost/bench/..., trading-day index); treat `cost`/`bench` as
  optional when consuming it.
- Poller completion order (US-022): render/parse artifacts FIRST (so
  deterministically-bad artifacts degrade to an honest message instead of a
  retry loop), then post summary, upload chart, and update the run row to its
  terminal status LAST — the status flip is what removes the run from the
  `running` set, so a transient Slack failure retries the whole completion on
  the next poll. Terminal mapping from the upstream END message:
  end_code 0/None -> `completed`, -1 (operator stop) -> `stopped`,
  else -> `failed` (`terminal_status()` in poller.py).
